It must (some of these you may have to research to find a solution):

Have a start screen with buttons to start the game. HTML links / buttons would work. Bootstrap has a pretty good set of CSS for buttons.
Have an end screen when the player loses with buttons allowing them to restart.
At least 5 levels with different patterns of bricks.
At least 5 different types of bricks. Ex: plain bricks that break with one hit, metal bricks that take 5, exploding bricks that take out neighboring bricks. These are examples, you can come up with whatever type you want. 
The game should fill the screen and the window should be a fixed size, no larger than 1024x768, or 768x1024 depending on if you want the game horizontal or vertical. 
The window should not have a menu.
Different levels / screens can be separate HTML and JavaScript files or you could use JavaScript to control everything on a single HTML file.
